# Introduction
The 8-Puzzle Solver is a Python program designed to solve the classic 8-puzzle game using various search algorithms. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding and implementing search algorithms in artificial intelligence. The solver employs algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* Search to find the optimal solution to the 8-puzzle.
# Example: Breadth-First Search
python3 puzzle.py bfs 3,1,2,0,4,5,6,7,8

# Example: Depth-First Search
python3 puzzle.py dfs 3,1,2,0,4,5,6,7,8

# Example: A* Search
python3 puzzle.py ast 3,1,2,0,4,5,6,7,8
